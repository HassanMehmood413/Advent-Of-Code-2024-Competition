    "    \"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!\" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!\n",
    "\n",
    "    As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:\n",

    "    .A..A.\n",
    "    XMAS.S\n",
    "    .X....\n",
    "\n",
    "    The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:\n",

    "    MMMSXXMASM\n",

    "    MAMMMXMMMM\n",
    "    MXMXAXMASX\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ....XXMAS.\n",
    "    .SAMXMS...\n",

    "\n",
    "    Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn't actually an XMAS puzzle; it's an X-MAS puzzle in which you're supposed to find two MAS in the shape of an X. One way to achieve that is like this:\n",

    "    M.S\n",
    "    .A.\n",
    "    M.S\n",
    "\n",
    "    Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with . in the above diagram. Within the X, each MAS can be written forwards or backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's the same example from before, but this time all of the X-MASes have been kept instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .M.S......\n",
    "    ..A..MSMS.\n",

    "    M.M.M.M.M.\n",
    "    ..........\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, an X-MAS appears 9 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side and try again. How many times does an X-MAS appear?\n",
